#Install instructions

## Locating the terminal.

Click on the magnifying glass. Type "Terminal" when the search bar pops up. Double-click 
the application. Congratulations, you now have a terminal.

## Installing Git

In this lab, we use Git for doing back-ups of code and data. Eventually, as we progress, we 
will also use Git to do cool things like revert to previous revisions of code, and share data, 
scripts and results amongst our selves.

In the terminal, type:

```
git
```

This will pop-up a visual interface to install Git.

## Installing Python

Python is a really nice, general purpose computing language. We'll use a specific type of Python,
Anaconda, to do our computing activities. 

[This](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) website will walk you through the download.
