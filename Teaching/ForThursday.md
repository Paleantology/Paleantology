#For Thursday

### Register an account on Github.com, and email the user name

I'll add the address to the Paleantology repo for sharing code, data, and results.

### Open a git bash window, and change directories into the Paleantology/Teaching directory.

You may have to type 

```
cd
```

first to get into your user home.

Once in the teaching repo, type:

```
git add my_first_script.py

```

Or whatever you called your script. 

```
git commit -m "my first backup of a script!"

```

We'll pick up from here Thursday
